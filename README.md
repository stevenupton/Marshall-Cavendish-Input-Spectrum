# Marshall-Cavendish-Input-Spectrum

![Input](input.jpg)

Project based on Marshall Cavendish Input magazine implementations using Fuse Emulator

This project contains many of the code listings within the Input series. It's an ongoing project for fun and allows me to reminisce of the days of owning my first ZX81, and then the ZX Spectrum in the 1980's. I have the time and experience to improve and/or resolve the frustrating programs that did not work because of printing or entry errors.

Each folder contains a list of Spectrum .tap files inspired by the exercise in the Input magazine.

Each .tap file has been saved using "fuse" spectrum emulator.

## Loading tapes

Note that some files are examples data files used as loading/saving data only
